    * self ball
        - belongs to a player
        - skills
            + casted with mana
            + E.g., a water ball
                * water shooting: aoe, pushes enemyï¼Œdirection
                * water aura: decrease enemy friction for a while
                * fire immunity
                * waterfall: have a n% chance that one cast will
                  instantly clear the cd of all the skills.

        not controled
    * map:
        - XML format, mapreader.
        - background image.
        - static map class, dynamic map components (E.g., destoryable walls) are stored in game state.
    * [classes need interface]
    * client game loop:
        - has state, server, renderer
        - loops every 33 msecs
    * game state:
        - ball, ...data
    * game server:
        - Server.stepOnce :: GameState -> GameMove -> IO GameState
        - receive input
        - input validating
        - game logic
        - archivement counting
        - send new game state
        - loops every 33 msecs
    * game renderer:
        - renders game state.

[ongoing, to be discussed]
